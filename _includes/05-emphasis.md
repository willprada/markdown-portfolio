I prefer to make things with programming languages like **python**, **javascript**, **Kotlin** and **C/C++**, but I also can work some bits with *PHP* and *Java*.

I have always used **UML** because it was required by almost every client.  But some new jobs require **agile methodologies** and I am learning a lot about them too.

_Every job, requires the right tool._
